#purpose
smpl.grd is a stupidly simple responsive grid system built with flexbox. it's meant to be an easy-to-customize grid solution for those looking to avoid a bloated front-end framework.

##config
a compiled css file, `docs/smpl.grd.css`, is included with the default options. if you want to include the source file in your workflow simply download `src/smpl.grd.scss`. if you're looking for a customized build follow these simple steps:

1. run `git clone git@github.com:caseyjacobson/smpl.grd.git`
2. edit `src/smpl.grd.scss` with your desired options
3. run `yarn run sass` to build a new css file
